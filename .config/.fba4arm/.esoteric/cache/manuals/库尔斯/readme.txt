GAME DESCRIPTION:   
--------------------
Koules is a fun & silly physics-based homebrew game released in 1995 by Jan Hubicka for Linux. It is one of the first arcade-style games ever released for Linux and I've always liked playing it. So, I decided to bring it to the handheld masses.

You are the big yellow ball with eyes. You must knock out the other balls that come towards you (Evil Koules fighters). Small blue balls give you extra mass, while small green balls give you extra acceleration. Yellow balls give you tons of both. White balls steal all your power-ups. Gold balls allow you to steal power-ups from other balls. There are 99 levels and as you progress, the game introduces new elements and gets quite a bit harder. I suggest playing on the "HARD" difficulty for maximum fun, once you pick up the basics.

Don't worry, the game will explain the new elements to you as you move along.

TIPS:
--------
Instead of charging at everything you see, try to trick enemies into chasing you and dodge them at the last second. You can get them to crash into walls and the red/green holes that appear. Use the green "magnetic holes" for moving in a slingshot effect.

------------------------------
CONTROLS & TWO-PLAYER MODE:
------------------------------
START: Pause
SELECT: Exit to main menu
L+R TRIGGERS: Re-calibrate g-sensor

In one-player mode: you move with either the D-PAD or the A/B/X/Y buttons, your pick. G-sensor and analog stick control can be enabled from the main menu. If the g-sensor fails to work, that is a bug in the firmware currently being worked on. If you power-off your unit and hold the reset button for 30+ seconds that should get the g-sensor working again.

In two-player mode: two people play on one device, either deathmatch or cooperatively. Player 1 uses the DPAD and Player 2 uses either the A/B/X/Y buttons (GCW held horizontally) or the analog stick (GCW held vertically).
