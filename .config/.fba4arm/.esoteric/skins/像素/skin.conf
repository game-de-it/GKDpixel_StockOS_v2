# - ./skins/Default/{your_asset}
# - ./skins/{your_asset}

# this means that you can rely on there being
# - a font in the skin root folder
# - basic button icons in the Defaut skin folder
# - basic device icons in the Defaut skin folder
# and you can reduce the size of your skin pack if you use them

# display skin backgrounds for emulators etc
# backdrop images can be .png or .jpg.
# the most efficient place to put them is in a folder called {your_skin}/backdrops.
# the filename should match one of these three
# - the link name. eg. ReGBA
# - the executable name. eg. regba. Not so good for opk's, as this is always opkrun
# - the directory name. eg. gba
# only turn this on if you really mean it, as it involves a lot of sdcard scans
# which is why it defaults to off

# if there is a highlight image supplied with the skin, 
# it needs to be located at imgs/iconbg_on.png
# then this flag declares if it is scaleable or not....
# why ?
# because of the limitations of SDL 1.2, software scaling kills the Alpha channel,
# and so we take the colour of pixel (0, 0) AKA top left
# and consider anything else that colour to be transparent
# we also don't keep aspect ration in the scaling, 
# because cell sizes change ratio with row and column count
