Goldfinger Tutorial:
1. Instructions for use
This simulator is modified based on the open 
source ReGBA simulator, currently v7.0
Version can add up to 100 cheats
Please put ROM name.cht in /media/data/local 
of GKDmini /home/.gpsp/cheats
Create a new folder without CHEATS Note that 
the folder name is capitalized

For example, the rom name is The Legend of 
Zelda Shrinking Cap.zip then the cht file is 
the legend of zelda shrink cap.cht The overall 
path of cht is /media/data/local/home/.gpsp
/cheats/The Legend of Zelda Shrinking Hat.cht

2. Gold finger coding support

Currently supported cheat commands include:
direct
gameshark_v1/v2, v3
PAR_v1/v2, v3

Note:
direct is a cheat in vba format that starts
with 020, 120, 220, etc. Goldfinger
gameshark and PAR are encoded cheats, you 
can use cheats The code converter converts the 
direct (vba) code (generally starting with X20) 
into Coding of relevant coding conventions

3. Gold Finger Format

1. The content format of the cht file is:

Coded version Goldfinger name
8-bit encoding 8-bit encoding

2.GameShark, PAR format:

for example:
gameshark_v1 Lv100
CA499443 E0C1D4B1

The direct (vba) code (generally X20 open) can 
be converted by the cheat code converter. header) 
to the encrypted cipher of the relevant encoding 
specification

3.direct (vba) format:

direct_v1 Lv99
0201326D 00000063
//63's decimal is 99, because only 1 byte needs 
to be written,So the first digit of the address 
part is 0

direct_v1 HP
1201326E 000003E7
//03E7's decimal is 999, because only 2 bytes 
need to be written,So the first digit of the 
address part is 1

direct_v1 HP
0201326E 000000E7
//Same as the previous one, just write the data 
separately,Note that the data is put in reverse 
order after splitting,There is also a change in 
the first write control bit 0201326F 00000003

The first bit of the address part of the vba 
code is the number of bits to be written, and 
0 means writing
1byte, 1 means writing 2byte, 2 means writing 
3byte, 3 means writing 4byte 2-8 bits are the 
address, and the place where the number of bits 
in the data part is insufficient should be 
filled with 0


4. A cheat can contain multiple data

for example:
gameshark_v1 Highest ability
3271DC2A 0E36F849
E52D898C 68702D88
6EA4A70D 0A3E8D72

Note: There should be a line of space between 
each cheat (V5.0+ has been removed
This limitation), if you don't understand, 
you can check the sample
