c1 c2 c3 c4

where each value is a decimal number, the range
Apply from -255 to 255
GBC colors use the following algorithm:

Rfinal = ((( R*a1 + G*a2 + B*a3 ) >> 8 ) + a4)
Gfinal = ((( R*b1 + G*b2 + B*b3 ) >> 8 ) + b4)
Bfinal = ((( R*c1 + G*c2 + B*c3 ) >> 8 ) + c4)

General rule to avoid producing color
The valid RGB range over 0-255 is
The sum of 4 values ​​in a row should always be
between 0-255.
