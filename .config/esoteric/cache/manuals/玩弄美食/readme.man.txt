[STORY]
Although tiger mum forbids little Sheran to play with edibles, there is simply no way to stop him from playing with fruits found inside the deep jungle. Being shiny, smelling wonderful and tasting even better Sheran can't be kept away. So let's do the best we could do: Support him!

[ABOUT]
The game consists of two boards of fruits. The left field belongs to Sheran who needs to reproduce the right field 1:1 being able to proceed to the next level.

There is a total of five fruits. Once you control Sheran's prank and activate a field, the fruit inside the activated field morphs two steps, while the other fields located above, below, to the left and to the right, morph the fruit located inside only once.

The order of fruits is shown in the middle of the playing field.

Mango -> Turns into an orange
Orange -> Turns into a banana
Banana -> Turns into a pear
Pear -> Turns into an apple
Apple -> Turns into nothing, the apple disappears.

Don't forget: Hit on the spot, the fruit morphs two steps, while the surrounding neighbour fruits only morph once. It's not difficult to understand, just play the first few levels.

The "Scale2x" function used for antialias is an own recoded implementation by Yannick Erb and does not use the original GPL'ed code. You may want to check this page for more information on Scale2x: http://scale2x.sourceforge.net/

Please kindly note "scale2x", "bilinear antialias" and "scanlines", once activated, will intense CPU usage and might lead to slowdowns and higher energy consumption, which therefore will decrease battery life on portable devices. Availability of these functions is OS depending.
