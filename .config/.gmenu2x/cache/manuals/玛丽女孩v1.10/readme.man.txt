[The Story]

Evil Swampy and his followers have stolen the magic ruby, which made it once possible for Giana and Maria to return from their dream. Many creatures are after this ruby, but does it really have power, or was it just a coincidence?
As this is not bad enough, Swampy fell in love at first sight with Giana's sister Maria and shamelessly kidnapped her. She simply has been at the wrong place at the wrong time.
You take over the role of Giana, get back the magic ruby and most important of all, save your beloved sister Maria and get home save! Good Luck!

[Controls]

Standard controls on GCW Zero:
D-PAD/Analog left - Go left
D-PAD/Analog right - Go right
A - Jump
B - Shoot

Standard controls can be adjusted in the options menu.

[Items]

Giana is not helpless at all, just bump the star boxes with your head and hope for a nice goodies. Also few ordinary stones which can be bricked, might hold a surprise.

Wall Breaker - Giana's hairs morph into a stormy hairstyle, you now can break regular bricks.
Thunder - Thunder will give you the ability to shoot or increase the shoot power. There are three strengths, indicated by the battery icons on the top of the screen.
Clock - Catch a clock, get 20 extra seconds!
Heart - 1 UP

[Enemies & Bosses]

The regular enemies are usually pretty weak, just as in the original game. Most of the time it's enough to bump 'em with your feet.

Bosses are considered being hard, so make sure you find all bonus caves, so you can gain 1 UP each 100 rubies. You will need them desperately!

[Copyright & Stuff]

"The Great Giana Sisters" is a registered trademark. The Team behind this game does not intend to break any copyright, but to bring a high quality fan sequel free of charge to all Giana fans out there. Permission has been granted from the actual owners.

No one of the original team was involved in the creation of this game, besides Armin and Manfred giving feedback on (for now) pretty old betas.
