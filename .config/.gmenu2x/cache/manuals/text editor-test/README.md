glutexto fork
============

This is a version for RG350.

A very simple text editor for gp2x, wiz, caanoo and gcw. It is meant to edit a
config file, maybe adding a # here and there to comment things in and out. Don't
try to write a book with it. ;)
Furthermore it is a neat tool to view big logs

Own fonts
=========
If you want to use own fonts, put the ttf files just to
/usr/local/home/.config/glutexto/font or /usr/local/home/.config/glutexto/fonts.
They will appear at next start in the options menu.
