Gambatte-DMS emulator 
------------------------------------------------

Gambatte is an accuracy-focused, open-source, 
cross-platform Game Boy Color emulator written 
in C++. It is based on hundreds of corner case 
hardware tests, as well as previous documentation 
and reverse engineering efforts.

Save States
------------------------------------------------

There are 10 savestate slots available per game.
There are options in the menu for loading and 
saving states.

The default slot is always Slot 0.

The default slot will always be selected when
starting the emulator. The slot selection will
not be saved on emulator exit.

The default slot will be used by the savestate
autosave/autoload feature when enabled.


Emulator Options
------------------------------------------------

Here is a list of the available config options:

- Show FPS:
    Shows or hides the FPS counter.
    Default is "Off".

- Scaler:
    Allows to select between a range of scalers.
    Default is "No Scaling".

- Mono Palette:
    Allows to load external palette files for 
    use with monochrome GB games in DMG mode.
    The "Auto" option will try to find a palette
    with the same name as the ROM file, and it
    will load the default palette if it fails.

- Color Filter:
    Allows to load external filter files for 
    use with color games in GBC mode.

- DMG/GBC border:
    Allows to load external PNG border images
    for use in DMG/GBC mode.
    The "Auto" option will try to find a border
    with the same name as the ROM file, and it
    will load the default border if it fails.

- System Priority:
    Allows to select the system to use when
    a ROM supports both DMG and GBC modes.
    Default is "GBC".

- Savestates:
    Allows to set savestate related options,
    like autoload on game boot and autosave
    on game exit.

- Boot Logos:
    Allows to use GB/GBC BIOS files to display
    the splashscreen logo when loading a game.

- Ghosting:
    Enables or disables frame mixing to mimic
    the DMG LCD ghosting.
    Default is "DMG only".

    Allows the user to tune the control related
    settings.

- Sound:
    Allows the user to select between Mono and
    Stereo sound.
    Default is "Stereo".


Palette files
------------------------------------------------

Palette files are text files with the extension 
".pal" and its format must be:

0xRRGGBB 0xRRGGBB 0xRRGGBB 0xRRGGBB
0xRRGGBB 0xRRGGBB 0xRRGGBB 0xRRGGBB
0xRRGGBB 0xRRGGBB 0xRRGGBB 0xRRGGBB

Where each line is a separate 4-color palette
for each sprite layer, and the color order is:
"white" "light-grey" "dark-grey" "black".


Filter files
------------------------------------------------

Filter files are text files with the extension 
".fil" and its format must be:

a1 a2 a3 a4
b1 b2 b3 b4
c1 c2 c3 c4

Where each value is a decimal number, ranging
from -255 to 255 which gets applied to the 
GBC colors using the following algorithm:

Rfinal = ((( R*a1 + G*a2 + B*a3 ) >> 8 ) + a4)
Gfinal = ((( R*b1 + G*b2 + B*b3 ) >> 8 ) + b4)
Bfinal = ((( R*c1 + G*c2 + B*c3 ) >> 8 ) + c4)

A general rule to avoid the resulting colors
exceeding the valid RGB range of 0-255 is that
the sum of the 4 values in a row should always
be between 0-255.

Cheats
------------------------------------------------

Gambatte supports Game Genie and Game Shark
cheat codes. Each cheat system has its own menu.

Game Genie cheats:
------------------------

Game Genie codes can have 6 or 9 digits. They 
are applied once each and they can only be 
disabled by exiting the emulator and reloading 
the ROM.

To introduce a code, go to the Game Genie menu, 
highlight a code line and press A to enter edit 
mode. While in edit mode you can change the 
value of each digit by using the D-Pad.
When you're done, press A to save the changes 
or B do discard them.

If you're introducing a 6-digit code, just leave
the last 3 digits as zeroes and your code will 
be detected as a 6-digit code. If all digits are 
zeroes, the code is ignored.

There are up to 20 lines for introducing several
codes at once if you need to.

To apply the cheats, press Start, and then 
confirm the action by pressing A. The codes will
then be applied and the code list will be
cleared.

Cheat codes are not saved on emulator exit.

Game Shark cheats:
------------------------

Game Shark codes have 8 digits. They can be
enabled and disabled at any time.

To introduce a code, go to the Game Shark menu, 
highlight a code line and press A to enter edit 
mode. While in edit mode you can change the 
value of each digit by using the D-Pad.
When you're done, press A to save the changes 
or B do discard them.

If all digits are zeroes, the code is ignored.

There are up to 20 lines for introducing several
codes.

To enable the cheats, select the slot on the 
left of the codes and press A to toggle the 
desired cheat on and off. An empty slot means 
the cheat code is disabled, while a check mark
means it is enabled.

Cheat codes are not saved on emulator exit.
