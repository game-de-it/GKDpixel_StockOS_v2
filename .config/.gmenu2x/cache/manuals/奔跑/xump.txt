! A B O U T :

Xump is a simple one screen puzzle game initially released in 2005
by Psilocybin Development. This overhaul by Retroguru is a rewrite
featuring new graphics, new levels, new music... simply new 
everything. 

If you enjoy the game you can consider a donation, which will help
to fund our next project. Thanks a lot in advance :)

! S T O R Y :

Help Xump and his human master Holger to disarm mines on fields
located somewhere above our atmosphere. Collect coins by destroying
fields or mines but do not fall of the playing field.

! C O N T R O L S :

Default controls: 
UP = D-PAD UP 
DOWN= D-PAD DOWN
LEFT= D-PAD LEFT
RIGHT = D-PAD RIGHT 
PAUSE = START

Use the ingame menue to change keyboard, joystick or joypad behaviour.
The supported devices very much rely on the operating system and your
hardware.

We use SDL, SDL_Mixer, libmodplug and zlib. Consult and visit:

The "Scale2x" function used for antialias is an own recoded 
implementation by Yannick Erb and does not use the original GPL'ed
code. You may want to check this page for more information on
Scale2x: http://scale2x.sourceforge.net

Please kindly note "scale2x", "bilinear antialias" and "scanlines",
once activated, will intense CPU usage and might lead to slowdowns
and higher energy consumption, which therefore will decrease battery 
life on portable devices. Availability of these functions is OS
depending.
