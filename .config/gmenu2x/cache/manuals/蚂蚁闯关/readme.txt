 -- STORY --  

While Sqrxz wandered around on a sunny day,  
he was unaware that he had lost all his items
while enjoying the scenery. It was already   
dark until he recognized the loss. There was 
no possibilty, but to go back where he       
started the trip and save his things. If the 
loss was not already enough, strange         
creatures appeared. Will they be helpful?    

 -- ABOUT --  

Sqrxz requires fast reflexes and is a simply 
mindblasting Jump'n'Run puzzle game with high
frustration factor originally made in 1996 by
Marcus Vesterlund (Maze) and John Holmvall   
(Hojo) for DOS and Windows 9x.   
         
Sqrxz (2010) is a remake of the game with    
same name and has been created by Rodolphe   
Boixel (Thor), Shahzad Sahaib (Kojote), Simon
Butler and Brendan Ratliff (Syphus). Minor   
support came from Marcus Vesterlund himself  
who also gave permission to redo his game.   
Denny Müller (Mulle) supported the team with 
a Wordpress-Theme for the official page and  
Rabia Sahaib (Mahek) made three more levels. 
         
A remake should be usually bearing           
improvements, so does Sqrxz 2010. Beside the 
"classic" graphic mode, there is a new mode  
with "deluxe" graphics. The main gameplay    
has been modified in a way that you need to  
collect all items to open the door at the end
of each level, which makes some levels harder
than they actually already were. Extended    
"fun" is guarantueed with additional three   
levels, unseen before. Each level does have  
it's own chiptune and adds up to the retro   
feeling. A Top 10 highscore table will hold  
all your records. For the ones who like      
hidden features, there is even a small easter
egg!
