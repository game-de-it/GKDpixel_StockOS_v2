[About]
Super Transball 2 is an enhanced version of TRANSBALL 2, which is the sequel of TRANSBALL, a remake of the classic THRUST game (but mainly inspired in ZARA THRUSTA for the Commodore Amiga 500).

The game has many levels, in each level the goal is to find the white sphere, and carry it to the upper part of the screen. This may seem easy at the begining, but as the levels become more and more complicated, to reach the top of the screen can be extremely difficult...
To move through a the levels, you command a ship, that is atracted by the gravity of the planet. As if this wasn't enough, you will find enemies that fire you, doors and many other difficulties on your way...

[Ships]
You can choose between 3 possible ships:
* the SHADOW RUNNER: extremely fast, and with retropropulsors. But with very unpowerful weapons. This is not a ship for beginners, but is very good ship when you can control it!
* the V-PANTHER 2: the easiest to control ship. Medium speed, and medium weapons. 
* the X-TERMINATOR: really slow (and easy to control), but has very powerful weapons. The tactic you must follow with this ship is: as I cannot evade your bullets, I'LL KILL YOU!!

Depending on the type of your gameplay, you could find one ship better than another, but in principle there's no ship better than the other two.
