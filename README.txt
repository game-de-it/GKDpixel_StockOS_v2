MinUI is a minimal launcher for the
RGB30, Trimui Smart (and Pro), Miyoo
Mini (and Plus), M17, and RG35XX--all
from the same SD card. Why? Why not?

Installing

PREFACE

On devices that support two SD cards
(eg. RG35XX) I will use the name "TF1"
to refer to the card that goes into
slot one of the device. All other
instances of "SD card" or "primary
card" refer to the card that goes
into the second slot or to the sole
SD card of devices that only support
a single card. To get the most out of
MinUI on devices that support two SD
cards you should install MinUI on the
second card.

Copy all the folders from this zip file
to the root of your primary card.

----------------------------------------
Updating

This extras zip file is included with
every release, regardless of whether
its contents has changed or not. Refer
to the release notes to see what,
if anything, was added or changed and
copy just the desired updated pak(s) to
the corresponding device folder in the
Emus or Tools folders (eg. /Emus/tg5040
or /Tools/rgb30)

----------------------------------------
Bios files

You'll need to BYOB for the emulator
paks included in this zip file.

Native PICO-8 and Splore.pak
(RGB30-only)

Download the official PICO-8 fantasy
console for the Raspberry Pi from
https://lexaloffle.itch.io/pico-8 (If
you've bought a bundle on itch.io any
time in the last few years you might
already have a copy in your library
https://itch.io/my-collections) At the
time of writing, the file is named
"pico-8_0.2.5g_raspi.zip". Copy
that zip file into
"/Tools/rgb30/Splore.pak/". Copy
"/Emus/rgb30/P8-NATIVE.pak",
"/Tools/rgb30/Splore.pak", and
"/Tools/rgb30/Wi-Fi.pak" to your SD
card. (You also need the Wi-Fi.pak to
download PICO-8 games in Splore.pak.)

Place carts you would like to play
with native PICO-8 in "/Roms/Pico-8
(P8-NATIVE)/".

To exit Splore.pak, press
start. In-game select "EXIT TO
SPLORE". With a cart selected in splore
press start, select "OPTIONS", and then
"SHUTDOWN PICO-8".

To exit P8-NATIVE.pak, press
start. Then select "SHUTDOWN".

Please note that Splore.pak and
P8-NATIVE.pak don't/can't implement
MinUI's uniform features like the
in-game menu (including save states),
faux sleep, and quicksave/auto-resume.

----------------------------------------
Wi-Fi.pak (RGB30-only)

Open "wifi.txt" in a plain text
editor and enter your network name
and password on two separate lines and
save, eg.

  minui
  lessismore

Copy "Wi-Fi.pak" to "/Tools/rgb30/"
on your SD card. The first time you
open the pak (or any time you change
the contents of "wifi.txt") it will
update the network name and password
then connect. Subsequent launches will
toggle wi-fi on and off. Wi-fi will
drain the battery so it's best to only
enable it when you plan to use it and
disable it when you're done. Your Wi-fi
state persists across reboots.
